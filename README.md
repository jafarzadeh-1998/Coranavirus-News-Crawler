## Synopsis

This project is about **COVID-19** news and statistics. It would collect the statistics from worldometers.info/coronavirus/ website and collect news from both worldometers.info/coronavirus/ and presstv.com websites.

## Code Example

I use "Django" ,"requests" and "BeautifulSoup" to build up this project. "Django" is for creating server and rendering requests. "requests" lib is for sending *get requests* to those websites. "BeautifulSoup" lib is for parsing the content which is received from webistes.
If you want to use worldometers' news and statistics, should start with 127.0.0.1:8000/worldometers/ and in case you want to use pressTv's news, you should start with 127.0.0.1:8000/pressTv/.

## Motivation

I created this website for collecting and arranging datas that they have put them in one page to make them more accessible.
